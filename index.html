		<p class="testimonial">Whenever I am asked if I know a great wardrobe stylist, <span class="plainred">Grace</span> comes to mind. She is one of the most professional and talented wardrobe stylists I have met in my modeling career. I have worked with her for three of my shoots, and each time she amazes me with new creative ideas. She is prompt and offers many options for looks, and is also very helpful on set of the shoot. She is mindful when it comes to shoot concepts, and goes above and beyond to make sure you get the look you want. I would highly suggest working with Voila...Candi Joan (Model)

		<p class="testimonial"><span class="plainred">Grace</span> did a wonderful job! I came to her wanting a new look, one that was more professional and stylish, and I was amazed with the results.
